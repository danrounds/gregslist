**Greg's List**

This is a CSS exercise in reverse engineering--specifically a Craigslist clone with slightly nicer style.

The task was to reverse engineer this image:

I targeted Chrome, here. Firefox 49 almost works, but the hack I used to align the search button doesn't work, there. I don't know browser shims, yet, so that way, it shall stay.

I was tempted to structure the search results a bit differently, with some added semantic information, but that wasn't the point of the exercise.
